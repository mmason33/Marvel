# Marvel Voting App

React<br>
Express<br>
Node<br>
GraphQL<br>

To run the project, open terminal to your preferred working directory and:

```
git clone https://github.com/mmason33/Marvel.git
```

In this project there is a React front end running at `http://localhost:3000` and a Express backend running at `http://localhost:5000`. You'll need to have both running for this app to work correctly.

From the terminal, change your working directory to the `marvel` directory.
```
cd marvel
```

Run `npm start` to run the React front end on `http://localhost:3000`. Once that is running open another terminal window, change the working directory to `marvel` and run `node server.js`. You should see success messages from both commands.
